                    The current exammination procedures for authenticating, verifying, and tracking students and their identities, such as
                    attendance, check-in, check-out processes, and collection of their exam-solution booklets, is a non-digital process done using physical paper assets. 
                    These attributes are not mapped on a per-student identity level. It is a repetitive process to fill in student data manually on 
                    paper in examination booklets and check-in sheets. <br>
                    ExaMap is a digital exam-audit platform that offers an RFID-based check-in and attendance solution along with QR-code-based unique IDs
                    for examination solution booklets to digitize and increase the efficiency and integrity of these processes. 
                    This can significantly benefit academic and educational institutions and organizations by allowing them to secure information as well
                    as streamline their administrative processes which are generating and processing data associated with their examinations</p>

                            <li><span>Digital Organization of Exam Attendance</span><br>The system will create an electronic database to track 
                                each student's attendance status during an exam session. This data is presented on a clear, user-friendly dashboard

                            <li><span>Tap-based Check-in Check-out Process</span><br>Students can quickly check in and out of the exam by 
                                tapping their university RFID identification cards on the system's NFC readers, instantly updating their 
                                attendance status.</li>
                            <li><span>Information Security of Exam Materials</span><br>All exam-related data, including attendance, logs, 
                                and booklet IDs, is securely stored in the cloud using Google Firebase. This digital backup prevents the 
                                risks of lost or misrepresented information associated with paper records, as all interactions are 
                                digitally tracked and saved.</li>
                            <li><span>Reduced Procedural Time</span><br>The system minimizes the time and effort required for manual tasks,
                                such as recording attendance and managing exam booklets. Examiners and teaching assistants benefit from 
                                faster and more efficient record-keeping, reducing administrative workload.</li>

                    <h3 class="sub-title">How it works</h3>
                    <p class="about-text">
                        ExaMap is a digital exam-audit platform designed to streamline attendance and booklet tracking during examinations.
                        Using RFID-based check-ins and QR code mapping, ExaMap provides a secure, efficient solution for tracking each 
                        student's attendance and linking solution booklets to their records. The platform operates across three subsystems:
                        Access Control, PoS (Point of Sale), and an Administrative Dashboard. Together, these subsystems ensure a structured,
                        auditable, and user-friendly examination process, reducing manual effort and enhancing data accuracy and security. Moreover,
                        the data collected is securely stored on cloud database to ensure backups and real-time access for the administrative website.
                        Here's how each sub-system functions:
                        
                        <h4>1. Access Control Sub-system</h4> 
                        <p>This sub-system is the entry point of the ExaMap system, dedicated to managing and securing student entry and exit during exams.
                           Using RFID technology, this subsystem allows students to tap their ID cards on an NFC reader to verify their 
                           attendance and register their entry and exit times. Visual and auditory feedback is provided through LEDs and 
                           buzzers, ensuring students know their check-in status immediately. This data is transmitted to the cloud, 
                           where it is stored and made accessible for tracking and auditing.
                        </p> 
                        <br>
                        <h4>2. PoS (Point of Sale) Sub-system</h4>
                        <p> This sub-system serves as a handheld tool for exam proctors with an onboard UI, facilitating quick and accurate attendance 
                            recording during the exam. Through a tap-based RFID check-in, the PoS Subsystem verifies each student's
                            attendance and associates their unique ID with the exam session. Additionally, it uses an onboard Pi-Camera 
                            to scan QR codes on solution booklets, mapping each booklet to the corresponding student's record. This 
                            functionality reduces manual effort and ensures precise and digital tracking of exam materials.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>3. Administrative Sub-system</h4> 
                        <p> This sub-system provides a web-based dashboard for exam administrators to manage and oversee all examination
                            data in real-time. It aggregates information from the Access Control and PoS subsystems, giving a 
                            comprehensive view of student attendance, exam status, and booklet tracking. Hosted on the cloud, the 
                            dashboard allows administrators to monitor each exam session, review attendance records, and generate reports
                            securely. This subsystem offers a high level of visibility and control, helping administrators streamline 
                            examination processes and maintain data integrity.
